# cp-helper
The AIM of this project is to help competitive programmers in solving calculation-intensive tasks during contests.
I brushed up my concepts of HTML, CSS, & Javascript through this project,the website is completely based on DOM Manipulation.
This CP Helper is an invaluable tool for those working on coding challenges and competitions.
It offers a wide range of features that can help you with your programming tasks, such as performing complex and time-consuming calculations, debugging your code, evaluating test cases, and identifying patterns in test cases.
One of the biggest advantages of the CP Helper is that it allows you to complete these tasks with just a single click.
This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially when solving challenging problems.
Another key benefit of the CP Helper is that it can help you to identify patterns and trends in test cases.

# Issues I faced
* For large values, integer overflow was happening So I had to use BigInt Class of Javascript to store variables. 
* In mobile devices, Sticky position was not working, so I fixed it using Media Query in CSS
<br>

# New Things I learned
* Using BigInt Class in Javascript <br>
* Using Media Queries in CSS <br>
* DOM Manipulation in Javascript <br>
